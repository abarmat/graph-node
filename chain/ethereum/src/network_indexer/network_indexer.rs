/// Terminology used in this component:
///
/// Head / head block:
///   The most recent block of a chain.
///
/// Local head:
///   The block that the network indexer is at locally.
///   We get this from the store.
///
/// Chain head:
///   The block that the network is at.
///   We get this from the Ethereum node(s).
///
/// Common ancestor (during a reorg):
///   The most recent block that two versions of a chain (e.g. the locally
///   indexed version and the latest version that the network recognizes)
///   have in common.
///
///   When handling a reorg, this is the block after which the new version
///   has diverged. All blocks up to and including the common ancestor
///   remain untouched during the reorg. The blocks after the common ancestor
///   are reverted and the blocks from the new version are added after the
///   common ancestor.
///
///   The common ancestor is identified by traversing new blocks from a reorg
///   back to the most recent block that we already have indexed locally.
///
/// Old blocks (during a reorg):
///   Blocks after the common ancestor that are indexed locally but are
///   being removed as part of a reorg. We collect these from the store by
///   traversing from the current local head back to the common ancestor.
///
/// New blocks (during a reorg):
///   Blocks between the common ancestor and the block that triggered the
///   reorg. After reverting the old blocks, these are the blocks that need
///   to be fetched from the network and added after the common ancestor.
///
///   We collect these from the network by traversing from the block that
///   triggered the reorg back to the common ancestor.
